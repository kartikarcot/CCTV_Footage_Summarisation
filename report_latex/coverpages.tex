	\huge\bfseries Abstract

	\bigskip

	\justify
	The use of CCTVs has been on the steady rise in in the last decade, being used for the security of public and private establishments alike. With increasing crime rates in cities, there is a need for a smarter method to survey the video being recorded, rather than manually going through hours of footage, saving both time and labour. We propose to an efficient method to generate a summary of the footage. The project also aims to simplify the task further, by generating video summaries based on user query, thus showing exactly what is required. \\

	The process has been carried out in two phases, real-time and query phase. Real-time phase works on the raw CCTV footage working to detect motion, separate the foreground and background, extract this "tube of interest and store it. YOLO object detector is then run on the these tubes and the metadata is also stored. The query phase works on this intermediate data. The user selects the objects (ex: car, bike etc)  required in the summary. The required events are then selected, before being rearranged by an optimization algorithm like Simulated Annealing. A background of the input footage is simultaneously generated along with these processes. Finally, the rearranged tubes are blended into the background using poisson blending to generate the summary video. \\

	Both objective and subjective parameters have been used to evaluate the results. Objectively, the exhaustiveness (inclusion of all events), compression factor, and overlap factor have been considered. A compression factor of 4-5x was successfully achieved, while all significant events were selected to achieve excellent exhaustiveness. All trials also successfully managed to attain very less overlap factor, of less than 0.1. Subjectively, semantic structuring and realisticity of the footage were considered. Interacting events were always shown together(thereby maintaining semantic structuring). The blending of the tubes could however be better leading to a more realistic video.
